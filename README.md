# **AI Shield: Advanced Cyberthreat Detection with Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
**AI Shield** is an advanced anomaly detection system designed to monitor and analyze network traffic in real-time. It identifies unusual behavior patterns that may indicate cybersecurity threats, including intrusions, malware activity, and data exfiltration attempts.

## **Key Features**
- Real-time network traffic monitoring and analysis
- Machine learning-powered anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
- Interactive web-based dashboard for intuitive data visualization
- Built-in custom network traffic data generator for testing
- Automated threat mitigation recommendations
- Detailed anomaly reports with export functionality
- Support for various traffic patterns and network protocols
- Time-series analysis for trend and pattern detection

## **Technology Stack**
- **Backend:** Python 3.8+, Flask (Web Framework)
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5 (Responsive UI)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Anomaly Detection Models)
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy

## **Usage Guide**

### Running the Application
Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Generating Sample Network Traffic Data
1. Open the web interface.
2. Navigate to the "Generate Sample Data" section.
3. Select the start date and set the desired duration.
4. Click "Generate Sample Data."
5. Download the generated CSV file for testing or analysis.

### Analyzing Network Traffic
1. Upload a CSV file containing network traffic records.
2. Review real-time analysis results and anomaly scores.
3. Examine detailed visualizations and flagged anomalies.
4. Access and review automated mitigation recommendations.
5. Download comprehensive anomaly detection reports.

## **Production Deployment Recommendations**
For production-grade deployment:
1. Use a robust WSGI server such as **Gunicorn**.
2. Configure a reverse proxy server like **Nginx**.
3. Secure the environment with HTTPS and environment variables.
4. Enforce secure coding practices and regular vulnerability assessments.

## **Security Best Practices**
- Implement user authentication and role-based access.
- Validate and sanitize all file uploads and user inputs.
- Always deploy using HTTPS in production environments.
- Regularly update all dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Monitor application and server logs for suspicious activities.

## **Monitoring and Maintenance**
- Monitor logs in the `logs/` directory for error tracking.
- Regularly back up configurations and important files.
- Keep dependencies updated to the latest stable versions.
- Monitor system health and disk usage for upload and output directories.

## **Contributing**
We welcome contributions! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch.
3. Commit and push your changes.
4. Submit a Pull Request for review.

## **Troubleshooting**
**Common Issues:**
- **File Upload Failures:** Check and fix file and directory permissions.
- **Visualization Errors:** Verify the matplotlib backend configuration.
- **Memory Limitations:** Adjust batch sizes and optimize processing.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Review logging settings and optimize data processing.
